# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

This project adopts the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) and [Mozilla enforcement protocols](https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion) as governing standards, except where project-specific provisions explicitly override such standards.

Contributors requiring interpretation or clarification shall reference the [Contributor Covenant FAQ](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq) and [available translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations).

All contributors must comply with these conduct standards across all project spaces and communications without exception.
