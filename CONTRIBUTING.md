# Contributing

This repository, while publicly accessible, is designated exclusively for the personal use, and unsolicited contributions are prohibited without prior authorization from the repository owner, who reserves absolute discretion regarding contribution acceptance. All prospective contributors must open an issue to discuss proposed changes before submission, with the understanding that only typographical corrections shall ordinarily be accepted as pull requests.

No coding standards, formatting requirements, or naming conventions are mandated. Contributors assume sole responsibility for ensuring all submissions comply with applicable requirements within their respective jurisdictions prior to submission.

By virtue of any contribution to this project, contributors hereby acknowledge their agreement to be bound by and comply with the project's Code of Conduct, which agreement shall be deemed effective upon the submission of any contribution, regardless of whether the contribution is merged into the main branch or rejected by the repository maintainer.
